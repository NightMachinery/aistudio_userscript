#+begin_verse
Allow setting different notification modes for different minumum delays in an object:

{
 0: ["bell"],
 10: ["bell", "desktop_notif"],
 100: ["desktop_notif"],
}

The code should find the exact duration group and use the modes for that (i.e., should not run 0 delay list when 11 delay).
